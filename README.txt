** Read me **
~The set up runs Laravel version 10 (this is the latest release) on the backend and Vue JS ie. vue2 on the frontend.
~The Vue2 files are on the 'vuejs-frontend folder' (check on the same directory as this read.me file)
~The laravel backend is resident on the laravel-backend-apis folder - still on the same directory as this read.me file.
~I used a Axios - a RESTful api library to consume the backend endpoints from laravels api.php file.
~Also to achieve the draggable feature, I used the Vue draggable node module - find this on the HomeView.vue file of the vuejs-frontend folder
where all the frontend code is resident.
~On the backend, the business logic of the this basic application is resident on the TaskController.php file, the model is the Task.php and the 
resource is resident on the TaskResource.php file.
